# FBDQA2021A MMP Challenge

This is a simple machine learning project to predict the direction of future price changes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the direction of future price changes using machine learning algorithms. We will use historical data to train the model and predict future price trends.

## File Structure

- `data/` - Data folder containing training and testing data
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks folder containing data analysis and model training code
- `src/` - Source code folder containing the main machine learning algorithm implementations
- `readme.md` - Project description file

## Usage

1. Clone the project to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FBDQA2021A_MMP_Challenge.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model training.
